In this script we will implement our MSE and Cross Entropy loss functions, including both the forward and backward processes.
More details about customizing a backward process can be found in:

#TODO 1: Complete the CrossEntropyLoss function
class CrossEntropyLoss(torch.autograd.Function):
    '''
    Cross entropy loss function:
        loss = - log sum (q[i]*label[i])
    where
        q_i = softmax(z_i) = exp(z_i) / (exp(z_0) + exp(z_1) + ...)

    However, when z_i has a lager value, exp(z_i) might become infinity.
    So we use stable softmax:
        softmax(z_i) = A exp(z_i) / A (exp(z_0) + exp(z_1) + ...)
    where
        A = exp(-z_max) = exp(-max{z_0, z_1, ...})
    therefore we have
        softmax(z_i) = softmax(z_i - z_max)
